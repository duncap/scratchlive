# Scratch Live
Introducing "Scratch Live" - a premier live-streaming platform dedicated to the Scratch community. Designed with Scratchers in mind, this innovative tool integrates seamlessly into the Scratch editor through a universal browser extension. With just a single click, Scratchers can broadcast their coding sessions live to an engaged audience. Not only does Scratch Live notify your followers instantly when you're streaming, but it also fosters real-time interaction through a dedicated live chat. We are also exploring the possibility of introducing a donation feature, pending Scratch's approval, to further support our vibrant community of creators.

This repo houses all of the code and everything for the Scratch Live website.
